/*
 * TODO: formalise this relationship in a shared library
 *
 * Specifically:
 *  - getRoles converts a supposed "type" in a collection of roles (that includes itself)
 *  - By convention, the type is always the first role
 *  - Thus, you can get the original type (in theory) back out by getting the first role
 *
 *  This may need to change once we makes roles more flexible, if the end result is that
 *  types are initial collections of roles but users can gain or lose any role manually.
 *
 *  NB: these are also documented in /api/README.md
 *
 *  Related to: https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/2583
