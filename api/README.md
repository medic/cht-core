# Development

## Install

Get node deps with `npm ci`.

## Settings

Export a `COUCH_URL` env variable so sentinel knows what database to use. e.g.

```
export COUCH_URL='http://myAdminUser:myAdminPass@localhost:5984/medic'
```

If you are using CouchDB2.0 you need to also provide your node name. e.g.

```
export COUCH_NODE_NAME=couchdb@127.0.0.1 node server.js
```

If you want to allow cross-origin requests, add the flag `--allow-cors` when starting api. E.g.

    node server.js --allow-cors

## Run

`grunt deploy`

or

    node server.js

# Migrations

Migrations are scripts located in the `/migrations` directory, and are automatically by medic-api run before the webserver starts up.

Typically, migrations are used to run a specific edit on all docs in the database (e.g. add a field to all docs of type X), but you can do whatever you like in a migration.

Migrations are only run once, and are run in the order they were created, based on their `created` date. Only one migration is run at a time.

Migrations that error will cause medic-api to stop on an error, and will be attempted again the next time you start medic-api.

## Migration script api

Your migration script should have an export that looks like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  name: 'your-unique-migration-name',
  created: new Date(2016, 10, 20),
  run: function(callback) {
    // If your migrations errors
    return callback(err);
    // Or upon success
    return callback();
  },
};
```

Place your script in the `/migrations` folder and it will get picked up by medic-api at the next restart.

## Implementation, re-running migrations by hand

See [`migrations.js`](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/tree/master/api/src/migrations).

Importantly, the record of which migrations have been run is stored in the `migrations` array of an arbitrarily named document in CouchDB with the `.type` of `meta`. Because of this it can be a hard document to find, but you can get it using `curl`, and pretty print it with `jq`:

```
curl 'http://myAdminUser:myAdminPass@localhost:5984/medic/_design/medic-client/_view/doc_by_type?key=\["meta"\]&include_docs=true' | jq .rows[].doc
```

So, if you want to re-run a migration, delete its entry in the `migrations` list and re-run api.

## Troubleshooting
Given the error `StatusCodeError: 404 - {"error":"not_found","reason":"no such node: couchdb@localhost"}` or alike - check that the value of your COUCH_NODE_NAME environment variable equals the result of `curl -X GET "http://localhost:5984/_membership" --user user:pwd`.`

# API Overview

## Timestamps

Various properties throughout this API use a timestamp value, the
following formats are supported:

- ISO 8601 combined date and time with timezone of the format below where "Z"
  is offset from UTC like "-03", "+1245", or just "Z" which is UTC (0 offset);

       YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ
       YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ

- Milliseconds since Unix Epoch

A compatible value can be generated using the `toISOString` or `toValue` method
on a Javascript Date object.

### Examples

- 2011-10-10T14:48:00-0300
- 2016-07-01T13:48:24+00:00
- 2016-07-01T13:48:24Z
- 1467383343484 (MS since Epoch)

Get and update the app settings.

## GET /api/v1/settings

Returns the settings in JSON format.

## PUT /api/v1/settings

### Query Parameters

| Variable | Description                                                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| overwrite  | Whether to replace settings document with input document. If both replace and overwite are set, then it overwites only. Defaults to replace. |
| replace  | Whether to replace existing settings for the given properties or to merge. Defaults to false (merging). |

Returns a JSON object with two fields:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "upgraded": false
}
```

| Variable | Type | Description                                                                                             |
| -------- | ------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| success  | Boolean | Always `true`
| upgraded  | Boolean |  Whether the settings doc was updated or not


# Export

Request different types of data in various formats.

Each of the export endpoints except contacts and feedback supports a parameter which returns date formatted in human readable form (ISO 8601). Setting this parameter to false or leaving it out will return dates formatted as an epoch timestamp.

To set this parameter for a GET request use:

```
http://admin:pass@localhost:5988/api/v2/export/messages?options[humanReadable]=true
```

To set this parameter for a POST request submit this as the request body:

```json
{
  "options": {
    "humanReadable": true
  }
}
```

## GET /api/v2/export/dhis

Exports target data formatted as a DHIS2 dataValueSet. The data can be filtered to a specific section of the contact hierarchy or for a given time interval.

Parameter | Description
-- | --
dataSet | A DHIS2 dataSet GUID. Targets associated with this dataSet will have their data aggregated. (required)
date.from | Filter the target data to be aggregated to be within the month of this timestamp. (required)
orgUnit | Filter the target data to only that associated with contacts with attribute `{ dhis: { orgUnit } }`. (optional)

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "dataSet": "VMuFODsyWaO",
    "date": {
      "from": 949392000000,
    },
    "orgUnit": "KbY9DJ8mBkx"
  }
}
```

## GET /api/v2/export/reports

It uses the [search shared library](shared-libs/search) to ensure identical results in the export and the front-end. It also only supports exporting CSV so we can efficiently stream infinitely large exports.

### Query parameters

These are identical to the JS objects passed to the shared library, as if you were using it directly in Javascript.

You may either pass JSON in the request body using `POST`:

```json
POST /api/v2/export/reports
{
  "filters": {
    "forms": {
      "selected": [
        {
          "code": "immunization_visit"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Or using form-style parameters as `GET`:

```
GET /api/v2/export/reports?filters[search]=&filters[forms][selected][0][code]=immunization_visit
```

**NB:** this API is bound directly to this library. For more information on what queries you can perform with the search library, see [its documentation](/shared-lib/search).

## GET /api/v2/export/messages

Download messages.

```

### Errors

Response if the username already exists:

```
HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
Content-Type: text/plain

Document update conflict.
```

## POST /api/v1/users/{{username}}

Allows you to change property values on a user account. Properties listed above
are supported except for `contact.parent`. Creating or modifying people
through the user is not supported, see People section.

### Permissions

`can_update_users`, `can_update_places`, `can_update_people`

### Updating yourself

You do not need any of the above permissions if the user you are modifying is yourself. However, you are not allowed to modify your `type`, `roles`, `contact` or `place`.

Further more, if you're updating your `password` you must be authenticating via Basic Auth (either the header or in the URL). This is to ensure the password is known at time of request, and no one is hijacking a cookie.

### URL Parameters

| Variable | Description                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| username | String identifier used for authentication. |

### Examples

```
POST /api/v1/users/mary
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "password": "secret",
  "place": "eeb17d6d-5dde-c2c0-62c4a1a0ca17e342"
}
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```

## DELETE /api/v1/users/{{username}}

Delete a user. Does not affect a person or place associated to a user.

### Permissions

`can_delete_users`

### URL Parameters

| Variable | Description                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| username | String identifier used for authentication. |

### Examples

```

```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## GET /api/v1/users-info

Returns the number of documents an offline user would replicate, along with a `warn` flag if this number exceeds the recommended limit (now set at 10 000).

When the authenticated requester has an offline role, it returns the requester doc count.
##### Example
```
GET /api/v1/users-info -H 'Cookie: AuthSession=OFFLINE_USER_SESSION;'
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "total_docs": 5678,
  "warn": false,
  "limit: 10000
}
```

When the requester has an online role, the following query parameters are accepted:

#### Query Parameters

| Variable | Description                                | Required | 
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| facility_id | String identifier representing the uuid of the user's facility  | true |
| role | String identifier representing the user role - must be configured as an offline role. Accepts valid UTF-8 JSON array for multiple of roles. | true |
| contact_id | String identifier representing the uuid of the user's associated contact | false | 
 
##### Example

```
GET /api/v1/users-info?facility_id={{facility_uuid}}&role={{role}}&contact_id={{contact_uuid}} -H 'Cookie: AuthSession=OFFLINE_USER_SESSION;'
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "total_docs": 10265,
  "warn": true,
  "limit: 10000
}
```

In case any of the required query parameters are omitted or the requested role is not configured as an offline role, the request will result in an error:


```
GET /api/v1/users-info?role={{online_role}} -H 'Cookie: AuthSession=OFFLINE_USER_SESSION;'
```

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "code": 400,
  "error": "Missing required query params: role and/or facility_id"
}
```

# Bulk Operations

## POST /api/v1/bulk-delete

Bulk delete endpoint for deleting large numbers of documents. Docs will be batched into groups of 100 and will be sent sequentially to couch (new batch sent after the previous one has returned). The response will be chunked JSON (one batch at a time), so if you wish to get an indication of progress you will need to parse incomplete JSON (with a library such as this one https://github.com/indgov/partial-json-parser).

### Permissions

Only available to online users.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| docs      | Array of JSON objects with `_id` properties |

An array of objects each with an `_id` property is required (rather than an array of strings representing ids) to ensure forwards compatibility if we choose to require that any additional document information (such as `_rev`) also be passed in to this endpoint.

### Errors

If an error is encountered part-way through the response (eg on the third batch), it's impossible to send new headers to indicate a 5xx error, so the connection will simply be terminated (as recommended here https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/2700).

### Examples

```
POST /api/v1/bulk-delete
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "docs": [
    { "_id": "id1" },
    { "_id": "id2" },
    ...
    { "_id": "id150" }
  ]
}
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
  [
    { "ok": true, "id": "id1", "rev": "1-rev1" },
    { "ok": true, "id": "id2", "rev": "1-rev2" },
    ...
    { "ok": true, "id": "id100", "rev": "1-rev100" }
  ],
  [
    { "ok": true, "id": "id101", "rev": "1-rev101" },
    { "ok": true, "id": "id102", "rev": "1-rev102" },
    ...
    { "ok": true, "id": "id150", "rev": "1-rev150" }
  ]
]
```

# Upgrades

All of these endpoints require the `can_configure` permission.

All of these endpoints are asynchronous. Progress can be followed by watching the `horti-upgrade` document and looking at the `log` property.

## POST /api/v1/upgrade

Performs a complete upgrade to the provided version. This is equivalent of calling `/api/v1/upgrade/stage` and then `/api/v1/upgrade/complete` once staging has finished.

### Example

```
POST /api/v1/upgrade
{
  "build": {
    "namespace": "medic",
    "application": "medic",
    "version": "3.0.0-beta.1"
  }
}
```

For potential forwards compatibility, you must pass the `namespace` and `application` as `medic`.

The `version` should correspond to a release, pre-release or branch that has been pushed to our builds server (currently hard-coded to https://staging.dev.medicmobile.org/builds). This happens automatically upon a successful travis run.

Calling this endpoint will eventually cause api and sentinel to restart.

It is expected that the caller ensures forwards or backwards compatibility is maintained between deployed versions. This endpoint does not stop you from "upgrading" to an earlier version, or a branch that is incompatible with your current state.

## POST /api/v1/upgrade/stage

Stages an upgrade to the provided version. Does as much of the upgrade as possible without actually swapping versions over and restarting.

Parameters are the same as `/api/v1/upgrade`.

You know that an upgrade has been staged when the `horti-upgrade` document in CouchDB has `"staged": true`.

## POST /api/v1/upgrade/complete

Completes a staged upgrade. Throws a `404` if there is no upgrade in the staged position.
