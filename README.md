# Medic Mobile

These instructions should help you get setup to run or develop on Medic Mobile.
For latest changes and release announcements see our [change log](Changes.md).

## Overview

Medic Mobile combines messaging, data collection, and analytics for health workers and health systems in hard-to-reach areas with or without internet connectivity.

The `medic-webapp` repository is the core tool of the Medic Mobile stack. When health workers submit data — using text messages (SMS), our mobile applications, or our SIM applications — the web app confirms data submission, generates unique IDs, and schedules automated reminder messages based on user-defined configurations. All information submitted by mobile users can be viewed, filtered, verified, and exported using the reports tab in the web application.

The web app is fully responsive with a mobile-first design, and supports localization using any written language. It can be installed locally, as part of a virtual machine (see [medic-os](https://github.com/medic/medic-os)), or in the cloud.

For more information about Medic Mobile's tools, visit http://medicmobile.org/tools.
For more information about Medic Mobile's architecture and how the pieces fit together, see [Architecture Overview](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/development/architecture.md).
For more information about the format of docs in the database, see [Database Schema](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/development/db-schema.md).
For more information about the SMS exchange protocol between webapp and gateway, see [Message States](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/user/message-states.md).

## Easy local deployment

If you want to get up and running with no fuss, [you can use Horticulturalist](#deploy-locally-using-horticulturalist-beta).

If you want to develop against Medic, follow the Development Setup below.

## Development Setup

Before getting started, read about our [development workflow](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/development/workflow.md) and the [architecture overview](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/development/architecture.md).

The setup described below doesn't use [Medic OS](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/development/architecture.md#medic-os), the tools will be run directly on your machine.


### Dependencies

You will need to install the following:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 8.11.x and above

[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) 1.7.0

[CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org) v2.x

### Setup CouchDB on a single node

NB: multiple CouchDB nodes will be more complicated, but the general pattern outlined below will be the same.

### Enabling a secure CouchDB

By default CouchDB runs in "admin party" mode, which means you do not need users to read or edit any data. This is great for some, but to use Medic safely we're going to disable this feature.

First, add an admin user:

 - If you are running CouchDB 2.x there is a wizard in Fauxton that does this for you, as well as initialising some databases. For more information see the [CouchDB install doc](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.0.0/install/).
 - If you are running CouchDB 1.x, run the following command to add an admin user:
```shell
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/_config/admins/admin -d '"pass"'
```

Now that's done, we must reconfigure CouchDB to require authentication:

```shell
# CouchDB 1.6
curl -X PUT http://admin:pass@localhost:5984/_config/couch_httpd_auth/require_valid_user \
  -d '"true"' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
# CouchDB 2.0
curl -X PUT http://admin:pass@localhost:5986/_config/chttpd/require_valid_user \
  -d '"true"' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Then create an actual admin user (note the username and password are the same as the admin user you created in the first step of this section):

```shell
curl -X POST http://admin:pass@localhost:5984/_users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"_id": "org.couchdb.user:admin", "name": "admin", "password":"pass", "type":"user", "roles":[]}'
```

After following these steps CouchDB should no longer allow unauthorised access:

```shell
$ curl http://admin:pass@localhost:5984 # should work
{"couchdb":"Welcome","version":"2.0.0","vendor":{"name":"The Apache Software Foundation"}}
$ curl http://localhost:5984 # should fail
{"error":"unauthorized","reason":"Authentication required."}
```

### Increasing `max_request_http_size`

Our application is larger than CouchDB's default request size, so we must increase it otherwise deployments may fail:

```shell
$ curl -X PUT --data '"4294967296"' http://admin:pass@localhost:5984/_node/couchdb@localhost/_config/httpd/max_http_request_size'
```

## Build and run

### Build the webapp

```shell
git clone https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp
cd medic-webapp
yarn install
```

### Add a precommit hook

Add a precommit hook to do static analysis before you commit to pick up issues before the build fails.

```shell
cp .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Then edit `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and add the following at the top just below the comments:

```shell
exec grunt precommit
```

### Deploy all the apps
Create a `.env` file in the app directory with the following contents
```shell
COUCH_URL=http://admin:pass@localhost:5984/medic
COUCH_NODE_NAME=couchdb@localhost
```
Then install webapp, admin, api and sentinel dependencies
```shell
cd webapp && yarn install && cd ..
cd admin && yarn install && cd ..
cd api && yarn install && cd ..
cd sentinel && yarn install && cd ..
```
Then run
```shell
yarn start
```
which will start the webapp, api, and sentinel, and watch for changes in each app.

### Deploy apps individually
If `yarn start` is not to your taste for whatever reason, the apps can be deployed individually.

#### Deploy the webapp

`grunt dev-webapp` will build and deploy the webapp, then watch for changes and redeploy when necessary.

#### Start medic-sentinel

```shell
cd sentinel
yarn install
export COUCH_NODE_NAME=couchdb@localhost
export COUCH_URL=http://admin:pass@localhost:5984/medic
```
Then run either `node ./server.js` from the sentinel directory or `grunt dev-sentinel` from the repository directory (which will watch for changes).

#### Start medic-api

```shell
cd api
yarn install
export COUCH_NODE_NAME=couchdb@localhost
export COUCH_URL=http://admin:pass@localhost:5984/medic
```
Then run either `node ./server.js` from the api directory or `grunt dev-api` from the repository directory (which will watch for changes).

### Try it out

Navigate your browser to [`http://localhost:5988/medic/login`](http://localhost:5988/medic/login).

### Data

To fill your app with generated data, you can batch-load messages from a CSV file, with the [load_messages.js](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/blob/master/scripts/load_messages.js) script.

Use `curl` to submit a single message:

```shell
curl -i -u gateway:123qwe \
    --data-urlencode 'message=Test One two' \
    --data-urlencode 'from=+13125551212' \
    --data-urlencode 'sent_timestamp=1403965605868' \
    -X POST \
    http://localhost:5988/api/v1/records
```

### Localization

All text labels in the app are localized. See the [translation documentation](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/development/translations.md) for more details on how to add new labels or modify existing ones.

## Tests
Check out the [Gruntfile](Gruntfile.js) for all the tests you can run.

### Unit tests
They live in the `tests` directories of each app. Run them with grunt: `grunt unit-continuous`.

### End to End tests
They live in [tests](tests). To run them:

1. Update and start Webdriver: `yarn run webdriver`
2. Run tests: `grunt e2e`

### API integration tests
`grunt api-e2e`

### Integration tests
[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/medic/medic-webapp) runs `grunt ci` every time some new code is pushed to github.

# Other deployment steps

## Deploy locally using Horticulturalist (beta)

[Horticulturalist](https://github.com/medic/horticulturalist) is an easy way to deploy Medic locally if you're not going to be developing against it.

Horti is currently in beta, and will eventually replace the Market, Gardener and Dashboard as our standard way to deploy and manage our software.

To use it locally:
 - Install, [configure](#setup-couchdb-on-a-single-node) and [secure](#enabling-a-secure-couchdb) CouchDB
 - Install [npm](https://npms.io/)
 - Install Horticulturalist with `npm install -g horticulturalist`

Now use the `horti` tool to bootstrap Medic and launch it:

```shell
COUCH_NODE_NAME=couchdb@localhost COUCH_URL=http://admin:pass@localhost:5984/medic horti --local --bootstrap
```

This will download, configure and install the latest Master build of medic. If you're looking to deploy a specific version, provide it to the `bootstrap` command:

```shell
COUCH_NODE_NAME=couchdb@localhost COUCH_URL=http://admin:pass@localhost:5984/medic horti --local --bootstrap=3.0.0-beta.1
```

To kill Horti hit CTRL+C. To start Horti (and Medic) again, run the same command as above, but this time don't bootstrap:

```shell
COUCH_NODE_NAME=couchdb@localhost COUCH_URL=http://admin:pass@localhost:5984/medic horti --local
```

If you wish to change the version of Medic installed, you can either bootstrap again, or use the [Instance Upgrade configuration screen](http://localhost:5988/medic/_design/medic/_rewrite/#/configuration/upgrade).'

**NB**: Horticulturalist doesn't wipe your database when it bootstraps, it just installs the provided version (or master) over whatever you already have. To completely start again, stop Horti and delete the `medic` database, either using Futon / Fauxton, or from the command line:

```shell
curl -X DELETE $COUCH_URL
```

## Run on Medic OS

[What's Medic OS?](https://github.com/medic/medic-os#about-medic-os)

For development, you can find it useful to [run Medic OS on a VM](https://github.com/medic/medic-os#instance-creation-iso) locally, to leverage VM snapshots, for instance to work with different versions.

You can also use Medic-OS for production instances.
