help.search.title = Freetext Search
help.search.description = <h4>Terms</h4> <p> A query is broken up into terms and operators. There are two types of terms\: Single Terms and Phrases. A Single Term is a single word such as "test" or "hello". A Phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as "hello dolly". Multiple terms can be combined together with Boolean operators to form a more complex query.</p> <p>When performing a search you can either specify a field by typing a field name followed by a colon "\:" and then the term you are looking for, or use the default fields. The default fields are\: patient_id, patient_name, caregiver_name and caregiver_phone, so if you do not specify a field name these will be used. If you would like the default search fields to change please send in a support request.</p> <h4>Fields</h4> <p>When performing a search you can either specify a field, or use the default field.</p> <p>You can search any field by typing the field name followed by a colon "\:" and then the term you are looking for.</p> <p>As an example, let's assume a Lucene index contains two fields, title and text and text is the default field. If you want to find the document entitled "The Right Way" which contains the text "don't go this way", you can enter\:</p> <pre>title\:"The Right Way" AND text\:go</pre> <p>or</p> <pre>title\:"Do it right" AND right</pre> <p>Since text is the default field, the field indicator is not required.</p> <p>Note\: The field is only valid for the term that it directly precedes, so the query</p> <pre>title\:Do it right</pre> <p>Will only find "Do" in the title field. It will find "it" and "right" in the default field (in this case the text field).</p> <p>You can search any field by typing the field name followed by a colon "\:" and then the term you are looking for.</p> <h4>Wildcard Searches</h4> <p>Lucene supports single and multiple character wildcard searches within single terms (not within phrase queries).</p> <p>To perform a single character wildcard search use the "?" symbol.</p> <p>To perform a multiple character wildcard search use the "*" symbol.</p> <p>The single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that with the single character replaced. For example, to search for "text" or "test" you can use the search\:</p> <pre>te?t</pre> <p>Multiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters. For example, to search for test, tests or tester, you can use the search\:</p> <pre>test*</pre> <p>You can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term.</p> <pre>te*t</pre> <p>Note\: You cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search.</p> <h4>Range Searches</h4> <p>Range Queries allow one to match documents whose field(s) values are between the lower and upper bound specified by the Range Query. Range Queries can be inclusive or exclusive of the upper and lower bounds. Sorting is done lexicographically.</p> <pre>title\:{Aida TO Carmen}</pre> <p>This will find all documents whose titles are between Aida and Carmen, but not including Aida and Carmen.</p> <p>Inclusive range queries are denoted by square brackets. Exclusive range queries are denoted by curly brackets.</p> <h5>Date Range Searches</h5> <p>When searching dates you need to include a strict syntax\:</p> <pre>reported_date<date>\:[2002-01-01 TO 2003-01-01]</pre> <p>This will find documents whose reported_date fields have values between 2002-01-01 and 2003-01-01, inclusive.</p> <h5>Integer Range Searches</h5> <p>When searching integers you need to include a strict syntax\:</p> <pre>last_menstrual_period<int>\:[10 TO 12]</pre> <p>This will find documents whose last_menstrual_period fields have values between 10 and 12, inclusive.</p> <h4>Boolean Operators</h4> <p>Boolean operators allow terms to be combined through logic operators. Lucene supports AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-" as Boolean operators(Note\: Boolean operators must be ALL CAPS).</p> <p>The OR operator is the default conjunction operator. This means that if there is no Boolean operator between two terms, the OR operator is used. The OR operator links two terms and finds a matching document if either of the terms exist in a document. The symbol || can be used in place of the word OR.</p> <p>To search for documents that contain either "jakarta apache" or just "jakarta" use the query\:</p> <pre>"jakarta apache" jakarta</pre> <p>or</p> <pre>"jakarta apache" OR jakarta</pre> <h5>AND</h5> <p>The AND operator matches documents where both terms exist anywhere in the text of a single document. This is equivalent to an intersection using sets. The symbol && can be used in place of the word AND.</p> <p>To search for documents that contain "jakarta apache" and "Apache Lucene" use the query\: </p> <pre>"jakarta apache" AND "Apache Lucene"</pre> <h5>+</h5> <p>The "+" or required operator requires that the term after the "+" symbol exist somewhere in the field of a single document.</p> <p>To search for documents that must contain "jakarta" and may contain "lucene" use the query\:</p> <pre>+jakarta lucene</pre> <h5>NOT</h5> <p>The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term after NOT. This is equivalent to a difference using sets. The symbol \! can be used in place of the word NOT.</p> <p>To search for documents that contain "jakarta apache" but not "Apache Lucene" use the query\: </p> <pre class\="code">"jakarta apache" NOT "Apache Lucene"</pre> <p>Note\: The NOT operator cannot be used with just one term. For example, the following search will return no results\:</p> <pre class\="code">NOT "jakarta apache"</pre> <h5>-</h5> <p>The "-" or prohibit operator excludes documents that contain the term after the "-" symbol.</p> <p>To search for documents that contain "jakarta apache" but not "Apache Lucene" use the query\: </p> <pre class\="code">"jakarta apache" -"Apache Lucene"</pre>
help.validation.title = Configuration of validation rules
