# Development Workflow

## Branching and Code Review

Before merging into master we should do code review, so either create a feature
branch or do your work in the dev branch.  Then submit a pull request to the
master branch (same repo) and have someone "ok" it for merge. You can @username 
in the pull request description to notify a specific person about the review.

Typically a small number of developers are working so they can share one 'dev'
branch where new code is developed.  It is at the discretion of the developer
and usually discussed with the team whether to start a separate feature branch
or not.
