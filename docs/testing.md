# Gateway Testing

## Setup

1. Install the gateway and bind it to an instance of Kujua, see the install doc.

2. Get at least two, ideally three, different phone numbers that can act as
Muvuku clients, a google voice account can help with this.

3. Modify this mockup data with your phone numbers as contact and upload to
Kujua Export.
