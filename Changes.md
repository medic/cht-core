- Added delivery form to generic ANC forms.

- Modified behavior of patient reports when `silence_for` option is empty we
  clear the entire schedule instead of a group.

- Fixed notifications to add the configured response #508

- Fixed bug and added support for multiple schedules in schedule silencing
    
    When `silence_for` is specified we should only silence/clear one group, I
    introduced a bug a few commits ago that would ignore the group and
    silence/clear based on date. Use the `silence_for` window to match and
    clear the first group.
    
    Also added support for comma separate string on `silence_type` option.
    In the MCH case we have two schedules that can be generated depending on
    the form submission/registration: ANC Reminders and ANC Reminders LMP.
    Now both schedules can be cleared with a single ANCV settings entry.


## 0.3.10

  unstructured messages were being ignored. #502

- added support for app-settings kanso package.
        
    Saving settings in dashboard was too slow for use because entire ddoc was
    being updated.  Using app-settings API fixes that.

## 0.3.6

## 0.3.3

### Apr 10, 2014

- Fixed spreadsheet keyboard navigation. #448

- Validate 'Everyone at x' for at least one valid phone number. #333

- Audit support for data records and facility data #415

    Also includes support for export of audit data as XML or CSV file.

    Note: Only new records and record edits will have an audit log entry.  So
    this means your audit log will only contain changes to records after the
    upgrade.

    Similarly browsing old revision will stop working for old records because
    they lack audit log entries.  If this is a major problem for you let us
    know and we can add backwards compatible revision browsing in the next
    release.

    This has been released as a standalone re-useable module for Node and
    browser environments: https://github.com/medic/couchdb-audit

- Added support for compact version of TextForms format #428

    In compact Textforms fields are delimited by spaces and determined by order.
    So no hashes or field keys are required like in classic TextForms format.
    If your field value has spaces in it then it must be surrounded by quotes
    unless it is the last field.

    Examples:

        REG 4165550000 John Smith
        REG "John Smith" 4165550000
    
- Include state change timestamps and patient_id in messages export #453
    
    Old Columns:

    Record UUID, Reported Date, From, Clinic Contact Name, Clinic Name,  Health
    Center Contact Name, Health Center Name, District Hospital Name, Message
    Type, Message State, Message Timestamp/Due, Message UUID, Sent By, To
    Phone, Message Body

    New Columns:

    Record UUID, Patient ID, Reported Date, Reported From, Clinic Contact Name,
    Clinic Name, Health Center Contact Name, Health Center Name, District
    Hospital Name, Message Type, Message State, Received Timestamp, Sent
    Timestamp, Pending Timestamp, Scheduled Timestamp, Cleared Timestamp, Muted
    Timestamp, Message UUID, Sent By, To Phone, Message Body

    Note: These are the default column labels and they are configurable.

- Disable facility select and show loading message until data is loaded. #452

- Updated font-awesome to 3.2.1 to get extra icons

- Fixed Help button on the spreadsheet. #455

- Fixed spreadsheet duplicate rendering when quickly switching tabs. #362 #450

- Added permissions checks to export lists functions. #456

- Fixed bug where facility spreadsheet update records when field value is
  unchanged. #457

- Fixed bug where registrations was not using db-wide unique IDs. medic-sentinel#54 

- Fixed duplicate records on ID search #430

- User Management UX refactor #385, #380, #462, #380, #379, #378, #377, #429

- Fixed bug on facilities screen where delete functions would stack up and
  inadvertantly delete a facility. #469


## 0.3.2

### Mar 11, 2014 

- fixed facilities spreadsheet bug #451 in Chrome
    
- minor user interface tweaks on deletion of facilities modal


## 0.3.1

### Mar 3, 2014 

- Fixed a bug where the facilities spreadsheet was holding focus so sending a message doesn't work. #440

- Added Bulk Messaging support, so you can send messages to multiple recipients. #333

- Fixed bug to include incoming messages in messages export. #436
    
- Fixed bug where it is possible to send a message twice by double clicking the submit button

- Fixed bug where we failed to retrieve settings on port 80 #438
    
    This was experienced when proxying to couchdb because http proxying will
    decode the URL including docid of the show parameter, so the show
    returns 404.  Solution is to always double URL encode if the show docid
    contains special characters.

- Confirm with user before deleting facility so they can't be deleted by accident. #371

- Added unique Patient ID validation support.  #411 medic-sentinel/pull/50

    Use unique('patient_id') in your registration validation rules to validate
    new form submissions that are setting the patient ID values via forms.

    Validation rules may consist of Pupil.js rules and custom rules.  These
    cannot be combined as part of the same rule.

    Not OK:        
    
        rule: "regex('[0-9]{5}') && unique('patient_id')"
    
    OK:
        
        rule: "regex('[0-9]{5}') && max(11111)"    

    If for example you want to validate that patient_id is 5 numbers and it
    is unique (or some other custom validation) you need to define two
    validation configs/separate rules in your settings. Example validation
    settings:

    ``` 
    [
      {
        property: "patient_id",
        rule: "regex('[0-9]{5}')",
        message: "Invalid: Patient ID {{patient_id}} must be 5 numbers."
      },
      {
        property: "patient_id",
        rule: "unique('patient_id')",
        message: "Invalid: Patient ID {{patient_id}} must be unique."
      }
    ]
    ```

- Added Conditional Alerts feature. #437  medic-sentinel/issue/52

    Configure the Alerts section of the App Settings to send a message when an
    incoming message meets the configured condition.
    
    
## 0.3.0-beta.39 (bugfix)

### Feb 25, 2014

- Fixed textforms whitespace parser bug when using form list field types. #431

    Textforms parser wasn't trimming space correctly on a field value, so if
    you had a list defined using those values they would never get matched.
    
    Textforms was only matching numeric values of length 2 or more, so if
    you submitted a one digit number you would not get a numeric match.
    
    Also if the value didn't match numeric or a date format then the
    whitespace was not being trimmed correctly.


## 0.3.0-beta.38 (debug) 

### Feb 13, 2014
 
- added logging calls to help debug and identify whitespace parsing bug #431


## 0.3.0-beta.37 

### Jan 21, 2014

- Fixes to user roles (@marc)
 
    Matches Transitional V2 in
    https://docs.google.com/a/medicmobile.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao9l2yegOFn7dEJRTEw1Z3RmZm0wTEo4Nk92NjVocnc

- Added support for Kemri Muvuku Form (KEMR)

- Added exclude_cols query param to csv/xml form exports. #421
    
    For example inlude `exclude_cols=1,5` in your query parameters to
    remove the first and fifth column of an export.

-  bugfix on export query params and UX adjustments

    Made English CSV export default. SpreadsheetML can be a little buggy
    because we're using HTML entities (not valid XML).
    
    Disabled default month value in exports screen since record count does
    not reflect the export row totals displayed.  It's probably better UX to
    have the user set the date knowing they are doing something than having a
    default that doesn't make sense with the totals on the screen and having
    to guess why that is.
    
- Added timezone support to exports #394

    Render page contents first and then load the fields data since that was
    holding up the page load.
    
    Indexing _id as `uuid` in field index so you can search for
    `uuid:10366976d62ab9a31257b2fad16113ee` now and it shows up in avaialble
    fields index.  For some reason I think underscore prefixed fields do
    show up in fields listing on Lucene for some reason.

- Fixed poor loading on search help #422


- added timezone support to exports #394
        
    Now dates in the exported spreadsheet should include your locale timezone. Controlled by the `tz` query param.
    
    
- Added new Messages Export and removed message data from Forms Export

    New http endpoint `/export/messages` to get messages export. Records are
    always latest first (reverse cronological).  Message export will include
    all records (valid and invalid), the point of the messages export is to
    give you access to all your message data, including outgoing error
    messages.
            
    **Warning**: the following URLs are no longer supported:
    
    ```
    /{form}/data_records.csv
    /{form}/data_records.xml
    /form_data_records.xml
    /form_data_records.csv
    ```
    
    Use `/export/forms/{form}` path instead.
    
    **Warning**: Existing form data export format has changed.  Included UUID of
    the related record so data among the two spreadsheets (messages and form
    data) can be correlated if need be.  Also removed the message
    data/columns from form data export. A record can be found via UUID by
    using `uuid:<the uuid string>` in the search box.
    
    Changed default column name of "From" to "Reported From".  Note if this
    shouldn't change if you have an existing install since it is generated
    based on your translation settings.

```
    The NEW columns (added UUID column and removed message data):
    
    Record UUID
    Reported Date
    Reported From
    Clinic Contact Name
    Clinic Name
    Health Center Contact Name
    Health Center Name
    District Hospital Name
    [columns for form fields data depending on form]
    
    The OLD columns:
    
    Reported Date
    From
    Clinic Contact Name
    Clinic Name
    Health Center Contact Name
    Health Center Name
    District Hospital Name
    [columns for form fields data depending on form]
    Incoming Message
    Responses
    Outgoing Messages
    Scheduled Tasks
```
