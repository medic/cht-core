_March 15, 2018_

### Migration notes

- [#3449](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3449): We included a feature which makes it unnecessary to use a `repeat-relevant` node in Enketo forms to workaround a bug which created an empty child. This node should now be removed.
- [#3629](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3629): We added more configurable text to the target widgets. Also, configuring an array of target titles is now deprecated in favor specifying a single translation key. Reconfigure your targets to specify values for `translation_key`, `subtitle_translation_key`, and `percentage_count_translation_key` properties. [Full documentation](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/targets.md).
- [#3818](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3818): We changed the way groups of scheduled messages are silenced when using `silence_for`. Previously, only the first group found to be in the silence window was silenced. Now, all groups are.

- [#4166](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/4166): People created via sentinel transitions are not replicated.
- [#4200](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/4200): Sentinel nulls out parent when multiple docs generated from one form submission.

## 2.13.0

_October 2, 2017_

### Migration notes

- [#2635](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/2635) changes the context available to the configured contact summary script. The `contact` parameter no longer has information about parents. This information is now in an array called `lineage`. More information is available in the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/contact-summary.md).
- [#3546](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3546) changes the implementation of the `contact_summary` so instead of declaring the output on the last line of the script, now you have to return the output. Usually this is as easy as adding a return on the last line, so `output;` becomes `return output;`. More information is available in the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/contact-summary.md).

### Features

- multi_report_alerts transition added to sentinel. See the documentation in [medic-docs](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/transitions.md). Issue: [#3416](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3416)

- Confirmation popup should not show on 'Error loading form'. Issue: [#3045](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3045)
- 'May lose data' warning displayed when form has no fields. Issue: [#1601](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/1601)

## 2.11.0

_April 12, 2017_

### Migration notes

- [#3230](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3230) changes patient ID generation so it automatically increases the length as needed, up to 13 digits. If you are validating incoming patient_ids in Sentinel, be sure to remove or correct any length restrictions, e.g. `^[0-9]{5}$` would become `^[0-9]{5,13}$`.
- [#3166](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3166) adds a new transition that adds patient_ids to every created person: `generate_patient_id_on_people`. Enable this transition if you want to send SMS about patients that may be created through the webapp.

  the `J1` format code.

## 0.4.3

_February 26, 2015_

### Features

- Major UI enhancements #370

  - Inbox Style with advanced search bar
  - Admin Panels
  - Mobile device support

- Configurable date format #577

- Built-in ANC Analytics #586

- Easy user feedback mechanism #19

- Added help and tour

- Refactored build process, added grunt, bower and jshint.

  configuration (settings and forms) persists through upgrades.

- Added new translations

- There are now two ways to export stuff: 1) from the reports screen click on
  export, or 2) on the Configuration > Export screen. The former is simplified
  and has no way of changing facility, form, or file format. The latter is
  functionally equivalent to 0.4.2.

### Upgrade Notes

- Gardener >= 1.1.0

- New [Nginx configuration](https://github.com/medic/medic-os/blob/3aedf0622eb0669aee2e5bbfba95a42faf05b9da/platform/packages/medic-core/settings/medic-core/nginx/nginx.conf), close or redirect port 5984, proxy all requests through medic-api.

  configuration (settings and forms) persists through upgrades.

## 0.3.11

_June 19, 2014_

- Fixed bug where scheduled messages were out of order on Chrome #527

- Fixed bug where app settings was ignored, and the app reverted to defaults. #524

- Added delivery form to generic ANC forms.

- Modified behavior of patient reports when `silence_for` option is empty we
  clear the entire schedule instead of a group.

- Fixed notifications to add the configured response #508

- Fixed bug and added support for multiple schedules in schedule silencing

  When `silence_for` is specified we should only silence/clear one group, I
  introduced a bug a few commits ago that would ignore the group and
  silence/clear based on date. Use the `silence_for` window to match and
  clear the first group.

  Also added support for comma separate string on `silence_type` option.
  In the MCH case we have two schedules that can be generated depending on
  the form submission/registration: ANC Reminders and ANC Reminders LMP.
  Now both schedules can be cleared with a single ANCV settings entry.

## 0.3.10

_June 12, 2014_

- updated intrahealth-senegal forms

  changes, otherwise configs never get triggered.

## 0.3.8

_May 22, 2014_

- fixed bug in messages export filters to include all data records,
  unstructured messages were being ignored. #502

- added support for app-settings kanso package.

  Saving settings in dashboard was too slow for use because entire ddoc was

- Modified KEMRI form fields to be ordered the same as KEMR form.

## 0.3.6

## 0.3.3

_April 10, 2014_

- Fixed spreadsheet keyboard navigation. #448

- Validate 'Everyone at x' for at least one valid phone number. #333

- Audit support for data records and facility data #415

  Also includes support for export of audit data as XML or CSV file.

  Note: Only new records and record edits will have an audit log entry. So
  this means your audit log will only contain changes to records after the
  upgrade.

  Similarly browsing old revision will stop working for old records because
  they lack audit log entries. If this is a major problem for you let us
  know and we can add backwards compatible revision browsing in the next
  release.

  This has been released as a standalone re-useable module for Node and
  browser environments: https://github.com/medic/couchdb-audit

- Added support for compact version of TextForms format #428

  In compact Textforms fields are delimited by spaces and determined by order.
  So no hashes or field keys are required like in classic TextForms format.
  If your field value has spaces in it then it must be surrounded by quotes
  unless it is the last field.

  Examples:

        REG 4165550000 John Smith
        REG "John Smith" 4165550000

- Include state change timestamps and patient_id in messages export #453

  Old Columns:

  Record UUID, Reported Date, From, Clinic Contact Name, Clinic Name, Health
  Center Contact Name, Health Center Name, District Hospital Name, Message
  Type, Message State, Message Timestamp/Due, Message UUID, Sent By, To
  Phone, Message Body

  New Columns:

  Record UUID, Patient ID, Reported Date, Reported From, Clinic Contact Name,
  Clinic Name, Health Center Contact Name, Health Center Name, District
  Hospital Name, Message Type, Message State, Received Timestamp, Sent
  Timestamp, Pending Timestamp, Scheduled Timestamp, Cleared Timestamp, Muted
  Timestamp, Message UUID, Sent By, To Phone, Message Body

  Note: These are the default column labels and they are configurable.

- Disable facility select and show loading message until data is loaded. #452

- Updated font-awesome to 3.2.1 to get extra icons

- Fixed Help button on the spreadsheet. #455

- Fixed spreadsheet duplicate rendering when quickly switching tabs. #362 #450

- Added permissions checks to export lists functions. #456

- Fixed bug where facility spreadsheet update records when field value is
  unchanged. #457

- Fixed bug where registrations was not using db-wide unique IDs. medic-sentinel#54

- Fixed duplicate records on ID search #430

- User Management UX refactor #385, #380, #462, #380, #379, #378, #377, #429

- Fixed bug on facilities screen where delete functions would stack up and
  inadvertantly delete a facility. #469

## 0.3.2

_March 11, 2014 _

- fixed facilities spreadsheet bug #451 in Chrome

- minor user interface tweaks on deletion of facilities modal

## 0.3.1

_March 3, 2014 _

- Fixed a bug where the facilities spreadsheet was holding focus so sending a message doesn't work. #440

- Added Bulk Messaging support, so you can send messages to multiple recipients. #333

- Fixed bug to include incoming messages in messages export. #436

- Fixed bug where it is possible to send a message twice by double clicking the submit button

- Fixed bug where we failed to retrieve settings on port 80 #438

  This was experienced when proxying to couchdb because http proxying will
  decode the URL including docid of the show parameter, so the show
  returns 404. Solution is to always double URL encode if the show docid
  contains special characters.

- Confirm with user before deleting facility so they can't be deleted by accident. #371

- Added unique Patient ID validation support. #411 medic-sentinel/pull/50

  Use unique('patient_id') in your registration validation rules to validate
  new form submissions that are setting the patient ID values via forms.

  Validation rules may consist of Pupil.js rules and custom rules. These
  cannot be combined as part of the same rule.

  Not OK:

        rule: "regex('[0-9]{5}') && unique('patient_id')"

  OK:

        rule: "regex('[0-9]{5}') && max(11111)"

  If for example you want to validate that patient_id is 5 numbers and it
  is unique (or some other custom validation) you need to define two
  validation configs/separate rules in your settings. Example validation
  settings:

  ```
  [
    {
      property: "patient_id",
      rule: "regex('[0-9]{5}')",
      message: "Invalid: Patient ID {{patient_id}} must be 5 numbers."
    },
    {
      property: "patient_id",
      rule: "unique('patient_id')",
      message: "Invalid: Patient ID {{patient_id}} must be unique."
    }
  ]
  ```

- Added Conditional Alerts feature. #437 medic-sentinel/issue/52

  Configure the Alerts section of the App Settings to send a message when an
  incoming message meets the configured condition.

## 0.3.0-beta.39 (bugfix)

_February 25, 2014_

- Fixed textforms whitespace parser bug when using form list field types. #431

  Textforms parser wasn't trimming space correctly on a field value, so if
  you had a list defined using those values they would never get matched.

  Textforms was only matching numeric values of length 2 or more, so if
  you submitted a one digit number you would not get a numeric match.

  Also if the value didn't match numeric or a date format then the
  whitespace was not being trimmed correctly.

## 0.3.0-beta.38 (debug)

_February 13, 2014_

- added logging calls to help debug and identify whitespace parsing bug #431

## 0.3.0-beta.37

_January 21, 2014_

- Fixes to user roles (@marc)

  Matches Transitional V2 in
  https://docs.google.com/a/medicmobile.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao9l2yegOFn7dEJRTEw1Z3RmZm0wTEo4Nk92NjVocnc

- Added support for Kemri Muvuku Form (KEMR)

- Added exclude_cols query param to csv/xml form exports. #421

  For example inlude `exclude_cols=1,5` in your query parameters to
  remove the first and fifth column of an export.

- bugfix on export query params and UX adjustments

  Made English CSV export default. SpreadsheetML can be a little buggy
  because we're using HTML entities (not valid XML).

  Disabled default month value in exports screen since record count does
  not reflect the export row totals displayed. It's probably better UX to
  have the user set the date knowing they are doing something than having a
  default that doesn't make sense with the totals on the screen and having
  to guess why that is.

- Added timezone support to exports #394

  Render page contents first and then load the fields data since that was
  holding up the page load.

  Indexing \_id as `uuid` in field index so you can search for
  `uuid:10366976d62ab9a31257b2fad16113ee` now and it shows up in avaialble
  fields index. For some reason I think underscore prefixed fields do
  show up in fields listing on Lucene for some reason.

- Fixed poor loading on search help #422

* added timezone support to exports #394

  Now dates in the exported spreadsheet should include your locale timezone. Controlled by the `tz` query param.

- Added new Messages Export and removed message data from Forms Export

  New http endpoint `/export/messages` to get messages export. Records are
  always latest first (reverse cronological). Message export will include
  all records (valid and invalid), the point of the messages export is to
  give you access to all your message data, including outgoing error
  messages.

  **Warning**: the following URLs are no longer supported:

  ```
  /{form}/data_records.csv
  /{form}/data_records.xml
  /form_data_records.xml
  /form_data_records.csv
  ```

  Use `/export/forms/{form}` path instead.

  **Warning**: Existing form data export format has changed. Included UUID of
  the related record so data among the two spreadsheets (messages and form
  data) can be correlated if need be. Also removed the message
  data/columns from form data export. A record can be found via UUID by
  using `uuid:<the uuid string>` in the search box.

  Changed default column name of "From" to "Reported From". Note if this
  shouldn't change if you have an existing install since it is generated
  based on your translation settings.

```
    The NEW columns (added UUID column and removed message data):

    Record UUID
    Reported Date
    Reported From
    Clinic Contact Name
    Clinic Name
    Health Center Contact Name
    Health Center Name
    District Hospital Name
    [columns for form fields data depending on form]

    The OLD columns:

    Reported Date
    From
    Clinic Contact Name
    Clinic Name
    Health Center Contact Name
    Health Center Name
    District Hospital Name
    [columns for form fields data depending on form]
    Incoming Message
    Responses
    Outgoing Messages
    Scheduled Tasks
```
