## Upgrade notes

There are no breaking changes when upgrading from 3.2.x.

## Purging

Documents on phones can now be deleted once no longer useful. This allows for space on the device to be recovered and improves performance. Read the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/purging.md) for how to add script to indicate that a document is no longer useful and is ready for purging. [[#5048](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/5048)]

## Outgoing messages screen

Administrators can now see all outgoing messages that are either scheduled, due, or unable to be sent. This is useful for monitoring the status of your SMS gateway and checking up on messages that have errored. [[#649](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/649)]

## Smarter outgoing phone number validation

For a long time it has been possible block outgoing messages being sent to a configured list of phone numbers. This is really useful for stopping messages to carriers and other automated systems that can cause messaging loops using up all your credit.

In 3.3.0 we have expanded on this feature to allow blocking of sending to phone numbers shorter than a certain length or recipients that only contain letters. These have been enabled by default so by upgrading your system will no longer SMS short or non-numeric recipients. For more information read the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/app-settings.md#optional-settings). [[#3675](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3675)] 

## ISO week validation

SMS forms can now validate ISO week fields for a given year using the built in `isISOWeek` rule function. For more information read the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/app-settings-validations.md#medic-mobile-validation-functions). [[#3155](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3155)]

## Better memory management

A bug in Node was causing the API service to consume more and more memory eventually causing Node to crash. [[#5255](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/5255)]

## Link reports to patients

When viewing a report about a patient the ID now links to the patient record so you can easily access more information. [[#3414](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3414)]
