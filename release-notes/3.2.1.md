# 3.2.1 Release Notes

## Bug fixes

### More reliable replication

In earlier versions if a device's replication connection got interrupted some documents may never be replicated to that device leaving it in an unknown state. To avoid this it is recommended that everyone upgrade to 3.2.1 or above as soon as possible. [[#5235](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/5235)]

### Refresh dialog not shown

When upgrading from 2.x to 3.2.0 the dialog to update isn't presented to the user. The user is unaware the app updated and would need to do a manual refresh to get the latest app changes. [[#5247](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/5247)]

## Performance improvements

### Unable to replicate a large number of documents

Users with a large number of documents are unable to replicate due to the software attempting to fetch all documents in one request. This fix reverts to the replication strategy used in previous versions. [[#5257](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/5257)]
