# 3.2.1 Release Notes

## Bug fixes

In earlier versions if a device's replication connection got interrupted some documents may never be replicated to that device leaving it in an unknown state. To avoid this it is recommended that everyone upgrade to 3.2.1 or above as soon as possible. [[#5235](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/5235)]
