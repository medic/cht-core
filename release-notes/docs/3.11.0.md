## Known issues

- [medic-android#127](https://github.com/medic/medic-android/issues/127): Image upload forms crash the app. This has been broken for some time and is not easy to fix while supporting Android 4.4 so the resolution has been deferred until we can make this breaking change. Reach out if you require this feature in the near future.

## Upgrade notes

- This upgrade can be rolled out remotely. Users will download the new version in the background and be prompted to reload the app when it's ready. A small amount of data will be needed to download the new version.
- Upgrading to this version does not require other applications to be upgraded. This release does not drop support for any hardware or software that works with the previous version.
- This release modifies some CouchDB view definitions so we recommend you Stage the upgrade and wait for the views to be rebuilt before rolling it out to minimize downtime.
- It is recommended to test the upgrade on a clone of your server first to ensure it works well for your application.

### Breaking changes

#### Removal of Reporting Rates feature

This feature wasn't documented or tested and hasn't been used in production for some time so it has been removed. To read more about this feature or if this breaking change affects you, read this [forum post](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/feature-removal-proposal-reporting-rates/1053).

### UI/UX changes

#### Android app

A few UI/UX changes were made to the medic-android app. It is safe to ignore this section if you are not updating android app right now.

##### Add UI for prominent disclosure when requesting permissions

The app will now require a one time authorization from the user to enable access to location information. This was required to comply with the latest Google Play Store requirements.

- [medic-android#136](https://github.com/medic/medic-android/issues/136)

##### Improve connection errors UX

If the user does not have a connection the first time the app is opened they will now see a user friendly error message with a retry button.

- [medic-android#163](https://github.com/medic/medic-android/issues/163)

##### Improve UX of crosswalk to webview migration

When migrating data from a Crosswalk apk to a Webview apk the user is now guided through the migration process so it can be upgraded without support. The migration was introduced in 0.6.0 for Android 10 and 11 devices to maintain compliance with Google Play Store policies. Read more about the transition to webview in this [previously released issue](https://github.com/medic/medic-android/issues/106).

### Supported software

There are no required changes to the [supported software matrix](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/core/overview/supported-software/) from `3.0.0`.

| Node | CouchDB | Browsers | SMS bridge | Android | medic-android | medic-couch2pg |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|
| 8.11+ | 2.1+ | Chrome 53+, Firefox latest | medic-gateway | 4.4+ | 0.4.5+ | 3.0+ |

## Highlights

### Angular upgrade

The UI framework has been upgraded from the deprecated AngularJS v1.6 to Angular v10.0 which drastically reduces the memory used on the phone. It will make development of the Core Framework easier and more reliable and also makes it easier to keep on the latest version of Angular which means we can keep up to date and on a supported version from now on.

- [cht-core#4750](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/4750): Move to Angular latest

### RapidPro SMS gateway

SMS messages can now be sent and received using a RapidPro instance. This allows for integration with a wide range of SMS aggregators for a high scale SMS deployment. Learn more in the [feature documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/guides/messaging/rapidpro).

- [cht-core#6532](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6532): Add RapidPro as an SMS Gateway

![RapidPro logo](./images/3.11.0-6532.png)

### Improved replication performance

API CPU usage has been significantly improved when requesting the changes feed, which is a frequently requested endpoint for smartphone applications.

- [cht-core#6577](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6577): Improve performance of subject lookups in authorization service
