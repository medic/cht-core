## Africa's Talking integration

Version 3.6.0 includes an integration with the [Africa's Talking](https://africastalking.com) SMS aggregator. This allows us to offer a cloud based alternative to managing your own `medic-gateway` devices. We have created a new routine and a new set of API endpoints to send SMS via Africa's Talking, process callbacks from Africa's Talking, and update the status of outgoing messages. Please note that this integration is disabled by default. For more information read the [configuration documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/guides/messaging/africas-talking/).

## mRDT timestamp metadata

Version 3.6.0 includes a backward compatible enhancement to the processing of mRDT metadata. Since `v0.1.5`, the `rdt-capture` app includes a timestamp representing how long it takes the CHV to capture the RDT. This piece of information is passed to the android wrapper `medic-android` which, since `v0.4.30`, passes it to the webapp. Once the mRDT form is submitted, this new field `timeTaken` will be stored in the resulting document.

## Performance

When we released `3.5.0`, we noted the existence of a performance regression when loading the list of Contacts. This issue has been resolved in `3.6.0`.
