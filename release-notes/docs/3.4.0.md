| Node | CouchDB | Browsers | SMS bridge | Android | medic-android | medic-couch2pg |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|
| 8.11+ | 2.1+ | Chrome 53+, Firefox latest | medic-gateway | 4.4+ | 0.4.5+ | 3.0+ |

## Scale to support more users

In previous versions users who had an internet connection would maintain a continuous request to the server waiting for any relevant database changes. For projects with thousands of users this caused the server to use a lot of memory to keep track of all of those requests.

This change removes the continuous replication in favor of making a short lived request when;

- five minutes has passed since the last replication attempt,
- the user creates or updates a document,
- we detect the user has come back online, or
- the user clicks the new "Sync now" button.
