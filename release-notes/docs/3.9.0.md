## Upgrade notes

### Breaking changes

#### Docker image update required

Prior to initiating an upgrade to 3.9, you will need to update the CHT Docker Image and a few packages inside the medic-os container.
Please closely follow our [3.9 CHT Docker Image Upgrade Process](https://github.com/medic/cht-infrastructure/blob/master/docs/3.9_CHT_Upgrade.md)

This image updates the horticulturalist package to [stage ddocs properly](https://github.com/medic/horticulturalist/pull/58).

#### Outbound Push only sends each report once

The implementation of Outbound Push has changed as part of [cht-core#6306](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6306). Now each configured outbound push will be sent only once per doc. Specifically, the first time your `relevant_to` function resolves to `true` is the first and only time a particular record will be send to a configured external service. This is to ensure that pushes are stable and predictable, and additional pushes are not sent unintentionally or unexpectedly. We are working on allowing for multiple pushes, please see [cht-core#6419](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6419) and contribute your situation to help us determine the best way forward.

#### Cleanup operations may impact app load times

We have implemented a purging function to clean up obsolete feedback and telemetry docs as part of [cht-core#5902](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/5902). This will free up disk space and improve performance over time, however initially may cause slower app load times while the backlog is cleared. The cleanup is capped to 1000 docs per app load to limit the impact on users.

### Supported software

There are no required changes to the [supported software matrix](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/core/overview/supported-software/#dependencies) from `3.0.0`.

| 8.11+ | 2.1+ | Chrome 53+, Firefox latest | medic-gateway | 4.4+ | 0.4.5+ | 3.0+ |

## DHIS2 integration

The CHT now supports calculating and exporting data for [DHIS2](https://www.dhis2.org) integration. The Core Framework can now be configured to calculate DHIS2 dataValues, aggregate patient level data, view aggregate data offline, and export the aggregate data formatted for DHIS2. The data is also available via an API so you can access it from an interoperability layer such as OpenHIM.

For more information read [the documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/features/integrations/dhis2/).

Issues: [cht-core#5661](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/5661) and [cht-core#6002](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6002)

## Supervise target progress

Targets can now be configured to be aggregated and synced to allow supervisors to view the progress of their health workers towards their goals. These new "aggregate" targets show an overview of all workers progress within their branch and can be selected to show each workers progress individually.

Read the [feature overview](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/features/targets/#supervisor-view) and the [technical documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/targets/#targetsjs) to see how to configure this new aggregated target.

Issues: [cht-core#4839](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/4839) and [cht-core#4840](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/4840)

## RapidPro integration

Interactive, structured messaging for health triage and clinical referrals is now possible with the integration of [RapidPro](https://rapidpro.io/). This opens new opportunities for a semi-automated, direct to patient approach to health assessments and care coordination at the community level. The Outbound Push feature has been extended to support submitting data to RapidPro so you can trigger workflows based on changes in the CouchDB database.

Read the [feature overview](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/features/integrations/rapidpro/) to learn more about this new integration.

Issues: [cht-core#6207](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6207)

## Case management workflows

For reports that aren't patient or place centric you can now register a case with a generated `case_id` short code. This allows subsequent reports to identify which case they refer to.

Read more about configuring the `accept_case_reports` transition in the [CHT documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/app-settings/transitions/).

Issues: [cht-core#6291](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6291).

## Instance monitoring

A [new API](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/api/#monitoring) has been added to allow tracking of a range of metrics in the CHT platform to make monitoring, alerting, and debugging of your instance easier.

Issues: [cht-core#6133](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6133)
