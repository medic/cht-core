## Performance

### Optimizing the history tab

We found that loading the History tab was taking a long time in projects with many places. This was due to loading the Places filter on the tab. By delaying the initialisation of the filter until needed we found performance improvements in three key areas. [medic#4423](https://github.com/medic/medic/issues/4423) and [medic#5455](https://github.com/medic/medic/issues/5455).

| Metric | 3.4.0 | 3.5.0 | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rendering the history tab | 7247ms | 1843ms | 75% |
| Rendering the history content pane | 1002ms | 732ms | 27% |
| Starting the application | 1020ms | 875ms | 14% |
| Idle memory usage | 453MB | 202MB | 55% |

### Optimizing sentinel processing

By reducing the throttling of change processing and reducing the number of database writes we have greatly improved the rate at which Sentinel processes changes. Clearing a backlog of 200 documents used to take 67 seconds, but with 3.5.0 this has been reduced to 33 seconds, a 50% reduction. [medic#4128](https://github.com/medic/medic/issues/4128).

To make Sentinel even more responsive to changes, transitions are now executed synchronously when messages are received. This means that replies are generated immediately and the user is notified of the success or error of their message as soon as possible. [medic#4857](https://github.com/medic/medic/issues/4857).

### Reducing the app size

After some analysis it was found that the webapp included font files that weren't required. Certain files weren't minified, and some others weren't compressed. These fixes combined reduced the size by 2.6MB making the application easier to download and update. [medic#5260](https://github.com/medic/medic/issues/5260), [medic#5489](https://github.com/medic/medic/issues/5489), and [medic#5490](https://github.com/medic/medic/issues/5490).

## Sort muted contacts

Muted contacts are now sorted to the bottom of the contact list so you can more easily see all your active contacts. [medic#5596](https://github.com/medic/medic/issues/5596).

## Facility EMR integration

Version 3.5.0 includes an integration with SIH, a facility based application in Mali. This enables patient referral information to be sent to a clinic and treatment data to be returned, closing the loop between the Community Health Worker and the clinic. This integration is possible thanks in part to a new [outbound push feature](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/outbound.md), which is configurable and will facilitate integrations with other systems in the future. [medic#5499](https://github.com/medic/medic/issues/5499), and [medic#4813](https://github.com/medic/medic/issues/4813).
