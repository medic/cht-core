## Upgrade notes

- This upgrade can be rolled out remotely. Users will download the new version in the background and be prompted to reload the app when it's ready. A small amount of data will be needed to download the new version.
- Upgrading to this version does not require other applications to be upgraded. This release does not drop support for any hardware or software that works with the previous version.
- This release modifies some CouchDB view definitions, so we recommend you Stage the upgrade and wait for the views to be rebuilt before rolling it out to minimize downtime.
- It is recommended to test the upgrade on a clone of your server first to ensure it works well for your application.

## Highlights

### Telemetry

The CHT-Core increased the frequency of telemetry data collection from monthly to daily, this new level of granularity is going to boost the metrics accuracy. Additionally, CHT-Core is gathering new information to support research initiatives, to help monitor and detect errors earlier and to contribute to the analysis of document replication.

Check the [telemetry](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/guides/performance/telemetry/) documentation for more details.

- [#6300](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6300): The difference between the client datetime and the server datetime, it helps to detect user's clock errors.
- [#6915](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6915): Access to granular telemetry data in daily frequency for post-hoc analysis, monitoring & research initiatives.
- [#6354](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6354): Access to replication information.

### Monitoring

The Monitoring API version 1 (`/api/v1/monitoring`) is now deprecated, but will continue to work. The version 2 (`/api/v2/monitoring`) is introduced with improvements in the returned data structure and new metrics available.

Check the [Monitoring API](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/api/#get-apiv2monitoring) documentation for more details.

- [#6607](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6607): The number of users that have connected to the api in a given number of days, it helps to detect when users are unable to connect to the server.
- [#6572](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6572): Outgoing messages information, it helps to determine the SMS failures rate.

### Contact summary, targets and tasks

The contact summary, targets and tasks now have more data available and a new CHT API with useful functions.

Check the [contact summary](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/contact-page/), [targets](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/targets/) and [tasks](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/tasks/) documentation for more details.

- [#6914](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6914): Ability to verify user's permissions from contact summary, targets and tasks by using the CHT API.
- [#6919](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6919): Access to UHC "home visits" information from contact summary.

### SMS

The CHT-Core will send a SMS when the origin phone number is not registered in the app:

- [#6650](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6650): Send an error message to users when `sys.facility_not_found` is generated.

### Muting

Muting and unmuting are now performed on-device for offline users. Previously, muting and unmuting were performed only on the server which meant that offline users would not see the results of submitting mute/unmute reports until they were synced and processed by the server. 

Check the [Muting](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/app-settings/transitions/#muting) documentation for more details. 

- [#6737](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6737): Improve how Muting is handled on device before syncs.
