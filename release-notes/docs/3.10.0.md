## Known issues

None.

## Upgrade notes

Sentinel no longer advances its transition processing seq in `_local/sentinel-meta-data`. Instead, it advances the transition processing seq in `_local/transitions-seq`. Additionally, a new document `_local/background-seq` advances the deletion processing seq. 

### Breaking changes

#### Updates to meta databases replication

The replication of users meta databases to the conglomerate, `medic-users-meta` database, is no longer configurable. 
This task now runs every day, at 2am UTC, and replicates `feedback` and `telemetry` documents to `medic-users-meta` database.

#### Android wrapper update required for new features

Some features in 3.10 are only fully functional while using the latest release of medic-android.

### Supported software

There are no required changes to the [supported software matrix](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/installation/supported-software.md) from `3.0.0`.

#### Supporting remote first-time login

3.10.0 adds a new authentication mechanism that doesn't require users to know their username or password. Users can now access the app for the first time by clicking on a token authentication link that they receive by SMS. Admins can enable or disable token authentication for any user. This feature requires the latest version of the `medic-android` app.  
See [the documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/api/#login-by-sms) for more information.

#### Supporting linked docs

To support the ability of sending SMS messages to people that are not primary contacts, contact documents now expose a new property, `linked_docs`, that can contain a collection of ids representing documents that are relevant to the respective contact. Every document listed in `linked_docs` will be shallowly hydrated when the contact is hydrated, thus providing a means of accessing the contents of these related documents everywhere the contact is used within the app.
This feature can have a multitude of applications, from providing a way to access an arbitrary contact's phone number when resolving an SMS recipient to linking a delivery report to a child person document (`linked_docs` can also be used in `contact-summary`).

#### Privacy Policies

App builders can now configure privacy policies for every language. When a privacy policy is configured for a language, users who load the app in this language are prompted to accept the policy, and are blocked from using the app until they have accepted. Privacy policies can be configured using `medic-conf` or from a new App Management page.    
See [the documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/guides/security/privacy-policy/) for more information.

#### More granular replication depth configuration for offline users

This release adds a new `replication_depth` configuration option that limits the depth of replicated reports. This allows app builders to configure roles that replicate deeper contacts, can report against these contacts, but will not download reports about these contacts that have been created by other users.  
See [the documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/guides/performance/replication/#report-depth) for more information.

#### Improved geolocation data

3.10.0 improves the way geolocation information is obtained, from requesting an instant position to allowing up to 30 seconds to get a position lock. Additionally, the `geolocation` property is now updated every time a report is edited, and the all previous geolocation entries are saved in a log within the same report.  
This change also supports the latest updates in `medic-android`, where Location permission is requested at runtime, when editing/creating a report, rather than demanded when starting the app for the first time.   

#### Customizable header tabs icons

As of 3.10.0, header tabs icons can be customized, allowing any [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/) icon or [resource icon](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/design/icons/) in SVG format to be used as a tab icon.
Tabs icons can be configured using `medic-conf` or from a new App Management page.  
See [the documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/app-settings/header_tabs/) for more information.

#### Improved performance of processing deleted docs

Because processing document deletes, specifically deleting read docs, is relatively time-consuming, increasing linearly by the number of users that exist on the instance, deletion processing is now split into: 
- generating tombstones: no changes, tombstones are generated like before, within the Sentinel transition processing feed.
- deleting read docs and info docs: done within a new Sentinel scheduled task that doesn't block the main transitions processing feed

Additionally, Sentinel scheduled tasks are no longer executed sequentially, they are now executed in parallel, keeping track of which tasks are running. Every 5 minutes, every scheduled task that is not already running is started.
