## Upgrade notes

### Breaking changes

#### Updates to meta databases replication

The replication of users meta databases to the conglomerate, `medic-users-meta` database, is no longer configurable.
This task now runs every day, at 2am UTC, and replicates `feedback` and `telemetry` documents to `medic-users-meta` database.

#### Android wrapper update required for new features

Supporting remote first-time login is only fully functional while using  medic-android version 0.5.0 or later.

#### Sentinel no longer advances its transition processing seq in `_local/sentinel-meta-data`

Instead, it advances the transition processing seq in `_local/transitions-seq`. Additionally, a new document `_local/background-seq` advances the deletion processing seq. A new migration is run when upgrading to generate the new local files.   

### Supported software

There are no required changes to the [supported software matrix](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/core/overview/supported-software/) from `3.0.0`.

| Node | CouchDB | Browsers | SMS bridge | Android | medic-android | medic-couch2pg |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|
| 8.11+ | 2.1+ | Chrome 53+, Firefox latest | medic-gateway | 4.4+ | 0.4.5+ | 3.0+ |

## Supporting remote first-time login

3.10.0 adds a new authentication mechanism that doesn't require users to know their username or password. Users can now access the app for the first time by clicking on a link that they receive by SMS. Admins can enable or disable this feature for any user. Users with the latest version of `medic-android` will have the option to open the weblink directly in the CHT app instead of a browser.

See [the documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/api/#login-by-sms) for more information.

## Supporting linked docs

To support the ability of sending SMS messages to people that are not primary contacts, contact documents now expose a new property, `linked_docs`, that can contain a collection of ids representing documents that are relevant to the respective contact. Every document listed in `linked_docs` will be shallowly hydrated when the contact is hydrated, thus providing a means of accessing the contents of these related documents everywhere the contact is used within the app.
This feature can have a multitude of applications, from providing a way to access an arbitrary contact's phone number when resolving an SMS recipient to linking a delivery report to a child person document (`linked_docs` can also be used in `contact-summary`).   
See [the documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/core/overview/db-schema/#contacts-persons-and-places) for more information.

## Privacy Policies

App builders can now configure privacy policies for every language. When a privacy policy is configured for a language, users who load the app in this language are prompted to accept the policy after logging in, and are blocked from using the app until they have accepted. Privacy policies can be configured using medic-conf or from a new App Management page.

See [the documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/guides/security/privacy-policy/) for more information.

## More granular replication depth configuration for offline users

A new `report_depth` option was added to the `replication_depth` configuration. This option allows offline users to replicate and report on contacts deeper in the hierarchy without having to replicate reports about those contacts that were created by other users.    
See [the documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/guides/performance/replication/#report-depth) for more information.

## Improved geolocation data

3.10.0 improves the way geolocation data is obtained. Previously, if the app was not able to obtain a position lock immediately, the geolocation would not be recorded. Now, the app will allow up to 30 seconds to get a position lock. Additionally, the geolocation property is now updated every time a report is edited, and all previous geolocation entries are saved in a log within the same report.    
This change also supports the updates in `medic-android` version 0.5.0, where the Location permission is requested at runtime rather than when starting the app for the first time.   

## Improved performance of processing deleted docs

Because processing document deletes, specifically deleting read docs, is relatively time-consuming, increasing linearly with the number of users that exist on the instance, deletion processing is now split into:
- generating tombstones: no changes, tombstones are generated like before, within the Sentinel transition processing feed.
- deleting read docs and info docs: done within a new Sentinel scheduled task that doesn't block the main transitions processing feed

##### Time necessary to process 500 deletes for 1000 users

Additionally, Sentinel scheduled tasks are no longer executed sequentially, they are now executed in parallel, keeping track of which tasks are running. Every 5 minutes, each scheduled task, that is not already running, is started.
