### UI/UX changes

#### Configuration for Task Due Date Display

By default, an overdue task is simply displayed as "Due today". This enhancement adds configuration to allow for displaying the number of days passed since the task's due date. This configuration is modified by setting the `task_days_overdue` value as described [in the documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/app-settings/#app_settingsjson). 

If the configuration is not set, there will be no UX changes to the way that overdue tasks are displayed.

### Household Tasks Landing Page

When a user with the `can_view_tasks_group` permission has completed a task for a particular household and there are additional uncompleted tasks for that household, a landing page is shown with a list of the remaining tasks. This allows the user to easily access all uncompleted tasks for the current household.

The behavior for existing users without the permission will remain unchanged.

## Highlights

### Collect form data from external Android apps

The CHT now supports forms that collect data from generic 3rd-party Android apps. Users can launch the apps from the form and then the output from the app is captured by the CHT and stored with the report. See the [CHT documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/forms/app/#android-app-launcher) for more information on how to use this feature.

An example use case for this functionality is [the CHT reference application](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/examples/covid-rdt-reference-app/) for COVID-19 point-of-care testing with Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT). This app provisions and captures the RDT data by integrating with Dimagiâ€™s [RD-Toolkit](https://github.com/dimagi/rd-toolkit/) app that guides health workers through the use of the RDT.

This feature requires the CHT External App Launcher functionality included in [v0.10.0](https://github.com/medic/cht-android/releases/tag/v0.10.0) of cht-android.
