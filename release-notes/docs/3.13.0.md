## Highlights

### Collect form data from external Android apps

The CHT now supports forms that collect data from generic 3rd-party Android apps. Users can launch the apps from the form and then the output from the app is captured by the CHT and stored with the report. See the [CHT documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/forms/app/#android-app-launcher) for more information on how to use this feature.

> One example use case for this functionality is to integrate a COVID-19 configuration with a rapid diagnostic testing app (such as [RD-Toolkit](https://github.com/dimagi/rd-toolkit/)) to allow capturing the results of the RTD in the CHT report.

This feature requires the CHT External App Launcher functionality included in [v0.10.0](https://github.com/medic/cht-android/releases/tag/v0.10.0) of cht-android.

### Household Tasks Landing Page

When the user has completed a task for a particular household and there are additional uncompleted task for that household, a landing page is shown with a list of the remaining tasks for that household. This allows the user to easily access all the tasks remaining for their current visit.
