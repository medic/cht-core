## Known issues

None.

## Upgrade notes

### Breaking changes

1. A new OS level dependency (`xsltproc`) is required for generating XFORM `html` on the server.
2. Not fully supported by `medic-conf@2.x`. For full functionality, users must upgrade to `medic-conf@3.x`.  

### Supported software

There are no required changes to the [supported software matrix](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/installation/supported-software.md) from `3.0.0`.

| Node | CouchDB | Browsers | SMS bridge | Android | medic-android | medic-couch2pg |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|
| 8.11+ | 2.1+ | Chrome 53+, Firefox latest | medic-gateway | 4.4+ | 0.4.5+ | 3.0+ |

## Configurable hierarchies

It is now possible to configure contact hierarchies.
This allows for better tailored solutions for new projects and opens up new configuration 
possibilities: for example having any number of place levels, multiple person types, or unbalanced place trees. 
The previously hardcoded contact hierarchy has now become the default hierarchy and 
existing projects will continue using it. For more information, please read the
[configuration information](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/app-settings.md#configuring-the-contact-hierarchy).

## Includes a new default configuration

Version 3.7.0 includes a complete default configuration that is enabled automatically 
on fresh application installations. The configuration is designed as a reference application 
for antenatal care. It provides a foundation for forms, data fields, 
and analytics to model an ideal way of structuring and organizing 
a workflow, its configuration code, and testing framework.

## Optimised form HTML generation

Generating the HTML for XForms is moved from being executed on every device to 
being executed once on the server. 
This reduces the time to initially load forms, along with reducing the memory 
footprint of the app by not caching every form's `html` and by not storing the additional files
required for generating it. 

## Improved purging now done server-side

Marking documents as no longer useful so that they don't take up mobile device resources 
is now handled server-side.
This enables devices to not download unnecessary documents during an initial replication 
and makes the actual "purging" process faster. 
For more information about changes in purging, please refer to the [purging documentation](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/purging-serverside.md).

## Warn when replicating too many docs

A warning is now displayed when a user would download more than the recommended maximum of 
10.000 documents. This warning is shown before starting initial replication in an attempt 
to reduce the incidence of misconfigured users.

## Performance

Users can expect faster replication, faster application load time and faster form load time:

| Action                  | Tecno-J5 on 3.7 | Tecno-J5 on 3.6 | Tecno-WX3 on 3.7 | Tecno-WX3 on 3.6 |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Initial load (*)        | 0:02:29         | 0:04:18         | 0:02:45          | 0:05:01          |
| Loading reports tab     | 0:00:20         | 0:00:32         | 0:00:25          | 0:00:44          |
| Process a specific form | 0:00:19         | 0:00:23         | 0:00:21          | 0:00:34          |

(*) Includes initial replication and and application bootstrapping for the first time.

We also fixed a bug where a user with a large number of documents trying to replicate could lock up 
medic-api.
