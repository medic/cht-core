## Migration notes
- [#3449](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3449): We included a feature which makes it unnecessary to use a `repeat-relevant` node in Enketo forms to workaround a bug which created an empty child. This node should now be removed.
- [#3629](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3629): We added more configurable text to the target widgets. Also, configuring an array of target titles is now deprecated in favor specifying a single translation key. Reconfigure your targets to specify values for `translation_key`, `subtitle_translation_key`, and `percentage_count_translation_key` properties. [Full documentation](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/targets.md).
- [#3818](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3818): We changed the way groups of scheduled messages are silenced when using `silence_for`. Previously, only the first group found to be in the silence window was silenced. Now, all groups are.
- [#4134](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/4134): Review use of `calculate="."` in all forms. If you have any XForm with with `calculate="."` you will need to modify the corresponding XLSForm, reconvert, and upload. The changes to make are:
  - From _type_ `calculate` to `string`
  - Make sure the _calculation_ column is **empty**
  - Have the _appearance_ as `hidden`
  - The _label_ can be `NO_LABEL` to avoid warnings and bloat in the form

## Features

- [#3096](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3096): Allow users to take a photo while filling in an xform in Enketo and upload the photo with the form.
- [#3459](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3459): Add format-date-tr() to our custom xpath functions to support translations of days and months in xforms.
- [#3450](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3450): Show the logout button in the hamburger menu for android users who have the new `can_log_out_on_android` permission set.
