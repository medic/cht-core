## Upgrade notes

### Breaking changes

The changes to [tasks and targets](#task-and-target-data-available-for-analysis) require a "3.8 compatible" partner configurations to be deployed for the tasks and target tabs to continue to function. You'll see errors on these tabs and the console error `Rules Engine: Updates to the nools schema are required` if the configuration is not compatible with 3.8. All "3.8 compatible" configurations are backward compatible and can be deployed safely to any Core Framework version. It is therefore recommended to deploy the "3.8 compatible" configuration before upgrading so your application will work seamlessly once the upgrade completes.
  * For partners using declarative configuration, ensure your configuration is deployed using [medic-conf 3.1.0](https://github.com/medic/medic-conf/blob/master/release-notes.md#31) or greater.
  * For partners maintaining their configuration in the legacy `rules.nools.js` file, ensure the latest [schema changes](https://github.com/medic/medic-projects/commit/3bb4cd5ade155cb7eca0e0ea6791cc82796d3949) are deployed.

These changes also result in new constraints for partner application task and target code:

* Tasks with multiple `actions` cannot use different contacts for their `actions[n].content.contact` values. For example, one action cannot open a form for contact `x` and a second action for the same task open a form for contact `y`.
* Reports "with errors" are now available in all task and target calculations (instead of just some calculations) and partner code is responsible for filtering them as necessary.
* For partners maintaining their configuration in a `rules.nools.js` file, multiple contacts emitting tasks with conflicting `id` values is no longer supported. This will result in errant behavior in 3.8.0.
* Target emissions with conflicting `id`s were previously merged based on the order in which the requesting contact was created inside CouchDB. It is now merged based on the order of the requesting contact's `reported_date` attribute.
* The specific meaning of task "resolution" has been augmented to accomodate the additional complexities of reporting a task's "state" in Postgres. Read [the documentation](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/developing-community-health-applications.md#core-framework-380-and-later) for more information.

### High sync times immediately after upgrade 

The changes to [tasks and targets](#task-and-target-data-available-for-analysis) may have significant [performance implications](#performance) for some users. Heavy users may see hundreds of new task documents created on their device the first time they load the task or target tabs after upgrading to 3.8.0. Users can expect longer than usual sync times for their first sync after viewing the task or target tab in 3.8.0.

### Supported software

There are no required changes to the [supported software matrix](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/installation/supported-software.md) from `3.0.0`.

| Node | CouchDB | Browsers | SMS bridge | Android | medic-android | medic-couch2pg |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|
| 8.11+ | 2.1+ | Chrome 53+, Firefox latest | medic-gateway | 4.4+ | 0.4.5+ | 3.0+ |

## Task and target data available for analysis

The task and target system has undergone a significant rework. It is now powered by [task documents](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/development/db-schema.md#tasks) and [target documents](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/development/db-schema.md#targets) which are written to PouchDB and synced to CouchDB/Postgres. This exposes task and target data in CouchDB and Postgres so queries can easily capture how tasks and targets are behaving for users in the field. These changes also set the foundation for powerful collaborative supervisor features to come in the future.

These changes have resulted in important performance changes for the app.

## Create Places by SMS

You are now able to create a place via SMS. This is useful if you wish to create a location before creating a person in that location (e.g. creating a new household before registering a member of that household).

For more information, please read the [configuration information](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/blob/master/configuration/transitions.md#add_place-as-of-380).

## Replication improvements

Sync status has been reworked to be clearer and more helpful. Specifically, it now specifies whether a lack of syncing is due to a missing internet connection:

See [the github issue](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/3977) for more information.

## Performance

The changes to [Tasks and Targets](#task-and-target-data-available-for-analysis) will have significant performance implications for projects. Many of these changes are hard to succinctly summarize and will vary greatly across project configurations and user types. Here are some performance changes you can expect in 3.8.0:

* *Less Memory Usage* - The retained JS heap size for idle users has been reduced. This reduction is significant for users with many reports or users with large reports. The retained JS heap size for our heaviest known users has been reduced by ~75%!
* *Large First Sync After Upgrade* - Expect longer than normal sync times for the first sync after the upgrade to 3.8.0. Some users may see hundreds of new task documents created on their device when they use the app after upgrading. These new documents need to sync to the server. 
* *Increased Disk Usage* - Writing task and target documents into PouchDB means the Core Framework will require more disk usage.
* *Reduced Time to Bootstrap* - The bootstrapping step `Loading rules…` has been removed. This results in drastically reduced bootstrapping times that remain constant regardless of document count. After the user's first replication and load, all users should be able to restart the app and bootstrap within one minute.
* *Long First-Load Time for the Tasks and Targets Tabs* - The loading previously done during the `Loading rules…` bootstrap step now loads the first time a user navigates to the "Tasks" tab or the "Targets" tab. Expect long load times the first time one of these tabs is viewed. But it is only once, even if the user closes the app.
* *Net Performance Gains* - After the first-load of the "Tasks" tab or the "Targets" tab, the tabs will load from a persistent cache. The cache is much faster than the first-load experience, but the tabs will load slower than in previous Core Framework versions. This is a performance trade-off which aims to reduce the _time to complete operations in CHT app_. The net result is a drastically reduced bootstrap time, and a slightly increased load time for specific tabs which provides a net reduction in load times for users to complete tasks.

These trade-offs are complex and we'd love to hear how these changes affect your users and your configuration. Send us your measurements or other feedback on the [CHT Forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/c/support/18).
