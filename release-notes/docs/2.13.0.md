# 2.13.0 Release Notes

## Migration notes

- [#2635](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/2635) changes the context available to the configured contact summary script. The `contact` parameter no longer has information about parents. This information is now in an array called `lineage`. More information is available in the [configuration documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/contact-page/#contact-summary).
- [#3546](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3546) changes the implementation of the `contact_summary` so instead of declaring the output on the last line of the script, now you have to return the output. Usually this is as easy as adding a return on the last line, so `output;` becomes `return output;`. More information is available in the [configuration documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/contact-page/#contact-summary).
