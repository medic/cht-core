## Upgrade notes

This release fixes issues around using the default hierarchy and having contact documents that have a default type (`person`, `clinic`, `health_center` or `district_hospital`) and also have a `contact_type` property. 

With configurable hierarchies, introduced in [3.7.0](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/blob/master/release-notes/docs/3.7.0.md#configurable-hierarchies), the `contact_type` property became reserved to determine the type of contact. 
However, projects could have used this property for internal logic in their configuration code before upgrading to 3.7, and could have contacts that have this property along with a default hierarchy type. 

The complete solution for these issues requires an upgrade to this release and recompiling and redeploying `app_settings` with [medic-conf 3.4.1](https://github.com/medic/medic-conf/blob/master/release-notes.md#340) or greater.
