# 3.8.1 Release Notes

## Upgrade notes

- CouchDB view code has been modified which will require rebuilding which may take some time depending on how many docs you have. We recommend you use the Stage feature to rebuild the views before upgrading to reduce server downtime.
- Webapp code has been modified and therefore users will download the application again.
