# 2.11.0 Release Notes

## Migration notes

- [#3230](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3230) changes patient ID generation so it automatically increases the length as needed, up to 13 digits. If you are validating incoming patient_ids in Sentinel, be sure to remove or correct any length restrictions, e.g. `^[0-9]{5}$` would become `^[0-9]{5,13}$`.
- [#3166](https://github.com/medic/medic-webapp/issues/3166) adds a new transition that adds patient_ids to every created person: `generate_patient_id_on_people`. Enable this transition if you want to send SMS about patients that may be created through the webapp.
