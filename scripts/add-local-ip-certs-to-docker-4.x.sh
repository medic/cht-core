# Helper script to download the certificate and private key
# from the http://local-ip.medicmobile.org service and install it
# in cht-nginx container in nginx. This script is safe to re-run
# as many times as needed or if you need to refresh expired
# certificates.
#
# After running this, you get a valid certificate with the format
# of https://YOUR-IP-HERE.local-ip.medicmobile.org
#
# For example, if your localhost IP is 10.0.2.4, you would use this as
# your URL for CHT:
#
#   https://10-0-2-4.local-ip.medicmobile.org
#
# By default this will use a container called "cht-nginx".  You can specify
# the container if you have a different cht-nginx named container, like this:
#
#   ./add-local-ip-certs-to-docker-4.x.sh cht-nginx-second-container
#
# As well, you can pass a second argument to specify which cert to install
# into the specified container. There are three options:
#
#   refresh - refresh the local-ip.medicmobile.org certificate [default action]
#   self - re-install the original self signed certificate
#   expire - install an expired local-ip.medicmobile.org certificate
#
# For example if you had a container called "cht-3-14" and you wanted to
# install an expired cert, you would call:
#
# ./add-local-ip-certs-to-docker-4.x.sh cht-3-14 expire
#
